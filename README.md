## 3. Power Model & Battery Estimation
### **Power Model Spreadsheet**
The power model spreadsheet contains:
- **Power consumption** of each component in different usage states (Off, Sensing, Interactive).
- **Duty cycle analysis** to determine the time spent in each state.
- **Battery capacity estimation** based on total daily energy consumption.

### **Screenshots**
The following screenshots show the completed power analysis:

### **How to determine the "days of use" metric?**
The days of use were determined based on:
1. **Total daily power consumption** (mWh), calculated from individual component power usage and duty cycle.
2. **Battery capacity** (mAh) converted to available energy (mWh) considering regulator efficiency.
3. **Estimated runtime** = (Battery energy) รท (Daily energy consumption).

### **What is the optimum size for the battery in my device?**
The optimal battery size was chosen as **1000mAh (3.7V)**, as it provides sufficient energy for **approximately 3 days of operation**. If extended runtime is required, a **1200mAh or 1500mAh** battery could be used.

### **What hardware/software/cost/effort trade-offs could improve the user experience?**
Several trade-offs can optimize the system:
- **Hardware Optimization:**
  - Reduce LED brightness or duty cycle to save energy.
  - Use a more efficient DC-DC converter instead of an LDO to improve efficiency.
- **Software Optimization:**
  - Implement deep sleep modes for ESP32 when idle.
  - Optimize WiFi transmission frequency to minimize TX power usage.
- **Cost & Effort Considerations:**
  - A larger battery improves runtime but increases cost and weight.
  - Simplifying the circuit reduces power losses but might limit functionality.
